# About

The purpose behind the scenes when i was thinking on create a todo-list, beside the fact this is a classic implementation of what a javascript application can do, is to pratice **Test-Driven Development**, which is some of most important domain paradigm.

## TDD
Test-Driven Development is some of the most important pratices/paradigm behind Extreme Programming. Before use it, you should know a little bit about SOLID and Clean Architecture. I started this little project to have a feeling about this subject. And the result could not impress me more, i love it. Is simple, is safe for your code, make you think before create your component.

For front-end developers maybe it will be confusing at first time, on the other hand you can always test other approach, but i think this will be my favorite for the next years. We can use a lot of other good pratices mixed with this one. Which can bring very good readability, uncoupled and robust code.
